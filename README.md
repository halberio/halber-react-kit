## **Useful informations**

- In the config folder you find a file named api.js, here you need to add your Restful API url
- Also in config folder you can find the used axios instance for all requests so you can do things before or after sending & getting requests or responses
- I recommend to keep this structure of the project so you can work with a lot of conventions
- My Restful API is made with Laravel passport
- We are also trying to keep this project up to date by adding new features and using latest versions of packages
